## MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine


 


 ## Description 


 - Your Challenge this week is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.


- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 21 | MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

- As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers.

-  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it.

- This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Deploy the application to Heroku.

- A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels.

- Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

 ## Installation

  - To run this, if you want to test before you submit, you must do a build first, npm run build, and then do npm run start:dev 
Both are run from the root. The front end is at localhost 3001.

- In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

- To fulfill the Challenge, you’ll need to do the following:

Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

Deploy the application to Heroku.


## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.


  - Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

 ## Contribute 

 
 - Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.


## Tests

  
  - The front end is at localhost 3001.
